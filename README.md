# Esports-Pakistan
**Esports Pakistan** is a professional-level esports platform aimed at promoting competitive gaming in Pakistan. This website serves as the central hub for players, teams, and fans to engage with the esports community. It features a **Home** page introducing Esports Pakistan, a **Games** section showcasing all the titles available for tournaments, a **Registration** page for teams and clubs to join competitions, a **Ranking** section displaying official standings, and a **Schedule** page for upcoming tournaments. The **More** section provides additional information about the history of esports in Pakistan, upcoming events, and new developments.

From a **developer’s perspective**, the project follows a modular and scalable structure. Each page is designed as a separate component/module for easy maintenance and future updates. The backend will handle dynamic data for games, rankings, schedules, and registrations, while the frontend will provide a responsive, user-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile users. The system architecture supports integration with databases for storing player/team information, ranking algorithms, and event schedules, ensuring the platform can evolve alongside Pakistan’s growing esports scene.
